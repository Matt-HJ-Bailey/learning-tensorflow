# learning-tensorflow

These are the notebooks I created when using the Udacity Tensorflow course.

It covers the following topics:
- Simple CNNs
- Convolutional image classification networks
- transfer learning for image classification
- Time series analysis
- Using RNNs for time series forecasting
- Using LSTM cells for time series forecasting
- Using convolutional cells like WaveNet for time series forecasting
